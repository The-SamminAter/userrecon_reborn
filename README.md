# UserRecon Reborn

### Status: fully functional, 13 checks implemented, many more planned

This is a re-write of TheLinuxChoice's UserRecon, which is (mostly) broken. This re-write has some extra features, and is easier to maintain and add onto.

I suggest using this on on a shell with a black background (for visibility)

### To-do:

- Addition/migration of all (original) site/username checks
- Add name variation option/checking

Find usernames across over 75 social networks
This is useful if you are running an investigation to determine the usage of the same username on different social networks.
